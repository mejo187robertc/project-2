          At 5 p.m. after a long day’s work, you drive your plug-in electric car
          to your garage. The car’s battery is fairly full because you drove
          little today. You plug your car into a charging station, but rather
          than recharge, you de-charge, pumping excess energy back into the
          power grid system and helping meet peak energy demand.

          <br />
          “It’s like the Internet,” says Dr. Alex Huang, an electrical
          engineering professor at North Carolina State University, “but rather
          than share bits of information—such as Twitter messages and YouTube
          links—you share electrons.”

          <br />
          Sharing energy is just one use of what has been dubbed the Smart Grid,
          a leaner, more intelligent version of the existing grid. As
          envisioned, it would use information technology and two-way digital
          communications to increase grid productivity, diagnose and treat its
          own problems, and allow consumers to better manage their energy use.

          <br />
          Experts claim this technology will save money for both consumers and
          utilities and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of
          Energy, for example, estimates that increasing the grid’s efficiency
          by 5 percent would be the equivalent of removing 53 million cars from
          the road. But some observers note the high cost of equipment to
          operate a smart grid system could short-circuit the effort.
          <br />Homes with smart meters connected to the Smart Grid could help
          to reduce lost power and save money. For example, a consumer could
          program his or her air-conditioning system to raise the thermostat in
          warm weather when demand for air conditioning rises or prices are
          high.
        </p>

      <div class="column middle">
        <p style="text-align: left">
          The Smart Grid could also increase access to distributed generation,
          or on-site renewable energy sources. Huang envisions intelligent homes
          equipped with small-scale solar generation units that could feed a
          large battery located at the edge of town.
          <br />“When demand is high, it’s more economical to use energy stored
          in a battery rather than turn on a coal-fired power plant,” Huang
          says. In addition to his work at North Carolina State University,
          Huang directs the National Science Foundation’s FREEDM Systems Center,
          which is developing Smart Grid components capable of storing and
          distributing renewable energy.

          <br />These transitions will not happen overnight.

          <br />The Department of Energy would like to see a comprehensive
          national Smart Grid by 2030. In northern Kentucky and parts of Ohio,
          Duke Energy, the nation’s third largest electric utility, will install
          700,000 electric smart meters and 450,000 natural gas smart meters
          during the next five to seven years. The installation will cover 84
          percent of Duke Energy’s utility customers in these two states.
          <br />Developing this system is also costly. Although Duke Energy has
          allocated $1 billion for hardware installation in Ohio, Indiana and
          the Carolinas over five years, these funds "won’t build our entire
          service area,” says Paige Layne, the marketing communications manager
          for Smart Grid technology at Duke Energy.

          The future cost to consumers will vary by state. In Ohio, for example,
          consumer rates increased 50 cents per month this year and will
          increase by $1.50 in 2010. But since customers will be better able to
          manage their consumption with Smart Grid technology, the bills will go
          down, says David Mohler, vice president and chief technology officer
          for Duke Energy. Last year, 35 participants in a pilot study in
          Cincinnati reduced their consumption by 10 to 20 percent.
        </p>

      <div class="column right">
        <p style="text-align: left">
          <br />The biggest challenge is battery technology, Mohler says.
          Vehicle batteries require a carrying capacity thousands of times that
          of a cell phone battery. Engineers have yet to develop one that is
          both cheap and reliable.

          <br />
          Still, pilot projects provide a glimpse of the future.

          <br />Xcel Energy aims to make Boulder, Colo., the first “smart” city
          by the end of 2009. And Duke Energy has already launched a
          self-healing grid in Hendersonville, N.C. When a tree fell on Duke
          Energy lines in June 2009, a nearby network station sensed and
          isolated the problem area. The station sent an automatic SOS to Duke
          Energy, quarantined the outage, and rerouted power to affected homes
          and businesses in a matter of seconds.

          <br />Without this intelligence, homeowners must report disruptions to
          the power company. Then a team of linemen rides the lines—through
          forests and up mountains with flashlights if necessary—to locate the
          injury. In the Hendersonville case, an additional 1,500 customers
          would have lost power.

          <br />“With Smart Grid, you don’t have to worry,” says Huang, “because
          software and communication take over.”

          <br />
          But developing a Smart Grid system alone will not solve all the
          problems of the existing grid or eliminate the need for additional
          power lines to acquire electricity from renewable resources, Mohler
          says. “Ultimately, we need to do both.”
